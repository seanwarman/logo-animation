    		<h4>Joining the dots.</h4>
    		<p>Lists in the CRM are one-dimensional illustrations of how 
          people used to buy products in the 90’s. Today, B2B buyers are 
          highly sophisticated, and involve many people in the decision, 
          often from across many departments. Unrival builds sophisticated, 
          insight led organograms to enable clients to navigate the complex 
          structures of the accounts they are looking to open up or expand within.

    		<h4>Uncover insights, not information.</h4>
        <p>
          Many ABM platforms aggregate press clippings, news alerts and present 
          these as “insights”. In today’s world when marketing and sales are already
          overloaded with too much data, this type of solution buries them under mounds 
          of useless, unactionable information. Enter Unrival. We focus on aligning 
          the subtle, often hidden pain points in public data about companies and people 
          to build a compelling map of stakeholders in an account and how best to reach them.

        <h4>Context, not just job titles.</h4>
        <p>
          CDO, CMO, CIO, CPO, CFO? Many job titles may be the same, but every 
          company has their own unique challenges, opportunities or market nuances. 
          We embrace these factors to help put you inside the mind of these 
          decision makers and their teams who influence them, bringing to life 
          their key challenges, viewpoints and motivations.
