# CSS Animation Example.

I styled this website for Unrival in December.

The opening logo animation you'll see upon arrival was created using 
CSS and pure Javascript.

The avatar web svg image was built with the help of [D3](https://d3js.org/)

You can see the site hosted from a AWS S3 bucket at:
