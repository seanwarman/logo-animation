          How do Sales identify the key decision makers and target 
          individuals in a more respectful and personalised way?
        </h4>
        <p>The challenges faced?</p>
        <p>
          Challenge 1: Understanding buying groups can be a real challenge.
           Identifying who the decision makers are and where they sit in 
          the organisation is a complex task, as well as deciding how to
           frame the approach when targeting these individuals. 
        </p>
        <p>
          Challenge 2: Sales often have junior relationships in their 
          accounts. How can Sales break into more senior levels of the 
          business to create executive sponsorship?
        </p>
        <p>
          Challenge 3: Traditional means of targeting clients and
          prospects are ineffective, outdated and often no longer
          compliant with data privacy legislation. Sales need to find
          new ways to create meaningful conversations with these
          individuals.
