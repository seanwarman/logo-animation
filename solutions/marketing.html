        <h5>MARKETING</h5>
        <h4>
          B2B marketers are facing a continually challenging landscape.
          Budget constraints, GDPR, data privacy, yet company growth
          remains imperative.
        </h4>
        <p>The challenges faced?</p>
        <p>
          Challenge 1: Marketers need to find new ways to stay relevant
          and engage their audience, define and execute the most
          effective ABM programmes, and continue to generate high-quality
          sales qualified leads, ahead of their competitors.
        </p>
        <p>
          Challenge 2: Traditional rules of targeting based on verticals,
          job roles, and company size are ineffective and outdated. As is
          generating content based on experience of their business and
          clients, and assumption of that industry.
