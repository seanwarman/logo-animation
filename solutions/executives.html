        <h4>
          Executives are continually facing challenges but the ability to 
          connect with their customers in a meaningful way is paramount. 
        </h4>
        <p>The challenges faced?</p>
        <p>
          Challenge 1: In today’s ever-changing world, executives need to 
          ensure that their teams are operating in a highly agile way. To 
          keep up with customers, executives must ensure that their teams are 
          able to respond to changes rapidly.
        </p>
        <p>
          Challenge 2: Executives themselves must maintain a constant 
          understanding of the customer and their needs. They are required to 
          create meaningful relationships with other executives, which can often 
          be challenging when both customer needs and leadership itself is 
          constantly shifting.

          Unrival provides executives with deep dive profiles into strategic 
          individuals – what are they interested in, what are their key 
          pains and passions? These profiles enable executives to have much 
          more meaningful conversations with their customers, framing the 
          conversation around what the customer is interested in, rather 
          than what the executive wants to discuss.
